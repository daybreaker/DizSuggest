<aside>When Disneyland first opened, we embarked on an ongoing learning process about our guests and how they respond to a story environment. For example, just after the park opened for business, we discovered that some guests had made a pathway through a flower bed. We were walking through the park one morning before opening when the gardeners came up to Walt and said, 'We need a fence to keep guests out of the flower bed.' Walt told them, 'No, we must pave this pathway. When guests make their own path, they probably have a damn good reason for doing it.'</aside>

<h1>Why this site?</h1>
<p>Walt Disney would often follow guests around the park to listen to their remarks. He knew that listening to the people would help him improve his park, to provide them with an even better entertainment experience. The wisdom of the crowd. For as many good ideas as Walt had, he was not too proud to accept criticism and make changes.</p>
<p>It seems like the Disney Parks these days are concerned more with the bottom line than with creating "Magic". Many people have ideas for improvements or changes that could increase everyone's enjoyment of the parks. But these ideas are often spread across message boards, podcasts, facebook, etc. Good ideas are lost in a sea of noise.</p>
<p>Mouse Sourcing is not just an internet petition site. It is a site where we can bring all these ideas together. Discuss them. Refine them. And maybe with the combined power of all of our voices, we can maybe get a few of these notcied by Disney.</p>
<p>We dont bring these issues up because we dislike Disney World, but because we know how much better it could be. We want to see the best Disney World possible, because we know it's a magical place. The Happiest Place on Earth.</p>
